# To handle capitalized words, there were lots of heuristics
#  and approaches we could have used, each with their own strengths
#  and weaknesses. Open-ended questions like this can really separate
#  good engineers from great engineers.

# Good engineers will come up with a solution,
# but great engineers will come up with several solutions,
#  weigh them carefully, and choose the best solution for 
#  the given context. So as you're running practice questions,
#   challenge yourself to keep thinking even after you have a
#   first solution. See how many solutions you can come up with.
#   This will grow your ability to quickly see multiple ways to
#    solve a problem, so you can figure out the best solution.
#    And use the hints and gotchas on each Interview Cake
#    questionâ€”they're designed to help you cultivate this skill.
